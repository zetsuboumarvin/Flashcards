# Flashcards
JetBrains Academy's project

For foreign language learners, itâ€™s hard to remember new words,
which is exactly what flashcards are for. Typically, flashcards
show a hint (a task or a picture) on one side and the right answer
on the other. Flashcards can be used to remember any sort of data.

## Used technologies
- Import from file and export to file
